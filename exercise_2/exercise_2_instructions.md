# Exercise 2 instructions

Welcome to exercise 2!

In this exercise we will ask you to review the graph that has been plotted in file **graph_exercise_2.html**. Your
task is to think about any possible ways in which you will improve any aspect of it in order to make it more interpretable.

The graph represents the data values collected by various sensors (same type) across an interval of time.

For this exercise there are no limits in what you can or not change about the graph, and you can use any
document format that you would like in order to present your suggestions and ideas.
